            <div className="text-sm text-gray-600 space-y-3">
              <p>
                <strong>Federal taxes:</strong> The IRS withholds 24% on lottery winnings over $5,000. However, large jackpots fall into the top federal tax bracket of 37%, meaning you&apos;ll owe an additional 13% when you file your tax return.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>State taxes:</strong> Most states tax lottery winnings at their top income tax rate. Eight states have no income tax (AK, FL, NH, SD, TN, TX, WA, WY), and California does not tax lottery winnings.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Lump sum vs annuity:</strong> The lump sum is typically about 50% of the advertised jackpot. While the total tax amount is lower, you receive significantly less. The annuity pays the full advertised amount over 30 annual payments (increasing 5% per year).
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Local taxes:</strong> Some cities levy additional taxes. New York City adds 3.876%, and Yonkers adds 1.959%. Baltimore, Maryland also has local taxes.
